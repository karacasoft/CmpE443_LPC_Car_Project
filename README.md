# Boun CMPE 443 Project

This was a group project for CmpE 443 Embedded Systems course.

The project was about building up a very simple self-driving toy
car system on an LPC4088 chip which runs an ARM Cortex M4 processor
with a multitude of peripherals.

Most of the low level module design was built by me. It may have inconsistent behavior 
so please check the code out before using it for your own project. There's no design guideline
I followed for this project. I tried to create an object oriented environment for drivers
and draw requirements graphs between them to decide what peripherals we should keep open.
I failed miserably while doing it and strict deadlines led me to design the horrible
abomination that resides in this repository.

High level logic was implemented by my friends. Check out the contributors list to reach out to them.
